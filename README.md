## FaceRS - Face Recognition System
FaceRS is an app powered by Python 3.9 and Streamlit. 

It allows users to add, delete, or adjust faces in the database using either uploaded images or a webcam. The system can recognize faces in images or live video, comparing them with known faces in the database. 

It's built with OpenCV for image processing, face_recognition for face detection and recognition, and YAML for configuration management. The application is user-friendly, interactive, and provides real-time feedback.
